# Largefile MCP Server

MCP server for working with large text files that exceed LLM context limits.

This server enables LLMs to navigate, search, and edit files of any size without loading the entire content into memory. It provides targeted access to specific lines, patterns, and sections while maintaining file integrity. Perfect for working with large codebases, generated files, logs, and datasets that would otherwise be inaccessible to AI tools.

## Goal

Enable LLMs to perform precise operations on files of any size through intelligent navigation, targeted search, and atomic editing, eliminating the context barrier that prevents AI tools from working with production codebases or very large documents.

## Planned Features

- **Smart Navigation**: Jump to specific lines, functions, or patterns instantly
- **Intelligent Search**: Pattern-based search across files without context limits
- **Precision Editing**: Atomic edit operations that preserve file integrity
- **Context Extraction**: Extract minimal relevant context for LLM consumption
- **Atomic Calculations**: Perform file-wide calculations without full loading
