# Foundation Setup Plan

## Overview
Setting up the foundational infrastructure for the largefile MCP server project.

## Tasks

### 1. Project Structure
- [x] Create initial src/ directory structure
- [x] Add placeholder implementations for core modules
- [x] Mark TODO items clearly for future implementation

### 2. Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Set up pytest structure
- [x] Create test directories matching src/ structure
- [x] Add basic test configuration
- [x] Create initial test cases for core functionality

### 3. CI/CD Workflows
- [x] Create .github/workflows/ci.yml
  - Type checking with mypy
  - Linting with ruff
  - Formatting with ruff format
  - Tests with pytest
  - Coverage reporting with codecov
  - Runs on main merges and PRs
- [x] Create .github/workflows/release.yml
  - Publishes to PyPI using uv publish
  - Uses PYPI_API_TOKEN secret

### 4. Development Scripts
- [x] Create scripts/ directory
- [x] Add pre-push script for local validation
- [x] Mirror CI checks in pre-push script

### 5. Dependencies & Package Setup
- [x] Set up pyproject.toml with proper dependencies
- [x] Configure uv for package management
- [x] Install dependencies and verify setup

### 6. Validation
- [x] Run initial tests to verify foundation
- [x] Ensure all tooling works correctly
- [x] Validate pre-push script functionality

## Success Criteria
- [x] All tests pass (7 passed, 15 skipped placeholder tests)
- [x] CI workflows are functional
- [x] Pre-push script validates code quality
- [x] Project structure follows design specifications
- [x] Clear TODO markers for future implementation

## Completion Summary

**âœ… Foundation setup completed successfully!**

All core infrastructure is in place:
- Complete project structure with all placeholder modules
- Full test suite with pytest configuration and coverage
- CI/CD workflows for automated validation and PyPI publishing
- Development scripts for local validation
- All code quality checks passing (linting, formatting, type checking)
- 68% test coverage with clear TODOs for future implementation

The project is ready for implementing the actual MCP server functionality according to the design specifications.
