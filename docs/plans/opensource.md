# Open Source Release Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the preparation tasks for converting the largefile MCP server to a public GitHub repository. The goal is to create clear, concise documentation that helps developers understand and use the project effectively.

## Documentation Style Guidelines

Based on existing MCP server documentation patterns:
- Clear, technical narrative structure
- Problem-solution approach with concrete examples
- Concise, developer-focused language
- No marketing fluff or verbose explanations
- Progressive complexity from quick start to advanced usage
- Hierarchical organization with descriptive headings

## Phase 1: README Rewrite

### Current Issues
- Existing README is incomplete with only "Planned Features"
- Missing actual implementation details and usage instructions
- No installation or configuration guidance

### New README Structure
1. **Problem Statement** - Clear articulation of large file context limits
2. **Solution Overview** - MCP server with 4 core tools for file operations
3. **Installation** - uv/pip installation instructions
4. **Quick Start** - Basic MCP configuration example
5. **Core Tools** - Brief overview of get_overview, search_content, read_content, edit_content
6. **Configuration** - Environment variables and advanced settings
7. **Usage Patterns** - Common workflows for code analysis, editing, debugging
8. **Performance** - File size handling (memory, mmap, streaming)
9. **Supported Languages** - Tree-sitter language support
10. **Contributing** - Link to contributing guidelines
11. **License** - Project license information

### Implementation Details
- **Action**: Delete existing README.md completely and rewrite from scratch
- **Style**: Follow diffchunk/directory-indexer documentation patterns
- **Content**: Focus on practical usage with clear code examples
- **Length**: Concise but comprehensive (similar to reference examples)

## Phase 2: Documentation Organization

### Current docs/ Structure
```

```

### Documentation Content Guidelines
- **Technical depth**: Detailed but accessible
- **Cross-linking**: Documents reference each other appropriately
- **Code examples**: Practical, working examples throughout
- **Consistency**: Uniform style and terminology
- **Completeness**: Cover all major features and use cases

## Phase 3: Content Review and Updates

### docs/design.md Verification
- **Review**: Check if design matches current implementation
- **Update**: Align any outdated architectural decisions
- **Clarity**: Ensure technical explanations are clear and concise
- **Completeness**: Verify all implemented features are documented

### Content Standards
- **Clarity**: Use simple, direct language
- **Accuracy**: Verify all technical details against implementation
- **Completeness**: Cover edge cases and error conditions
- **Examples**: Include practical code samples
- **Maintenance**: Ensure documentation stays current

## Phase 4: Final Review

### Documentation Quality Checklist
- [ ] All files use consistent markdown formatting
- [ ] Code examples are tested and working
- [ ] Cross-references are accurate and helpful
- [ ] Technical terms are defined clearly
- [ ] No marketing language or excessive verbosity
- [ ] Progressive complexity from basic to advanced
- [ ] Clear navigation between related documents

### Pre-Release Validation
- [ ] README provides clear value proposition
- [ ] Installation instructions are tested
- [ ] Configuration examples work correctly
- [ ] Usage patterns demonstrate real value
- [ ] API reference is complete and accurate
- [ ] Contributing guidelines are actionable

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**
   - README complete rewrite
   - docs/design.md verification and updates
   - Core documentation structure (api-reference, configuration)

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Usage patterns and examples
   - Performance documentation
   - Contributing guidelines

3. **Low Priority**
   - Documentation polish and cross-linking
   - Additional examples and edge cases

## Success Criteria

- Developers can understand project value from README alone
- Setup and configuration can be completed following docs
- Common use cases are clearly documented with examples
- Advanced features are accessible through detailed documentation
- Contributing process is clear and welcoming
- Documentation follows established patterns from other MCP servers

## Notes

- Maintain consistency with existing peteretelej MCP server documentation style
- Focus on technical clarity over marketing appeal
- Ensure all code examples are practical and tested
- Keep documentation maintainable and up-to-date
- Provide clear migration path for users from other solutions
