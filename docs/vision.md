# Largefile Vision

## Problem Statement

LLMs fail when working with large files due to context window limitations. Files exceeding 10k+ LOC cannot be processed effectively, preventing AI-powered development tools from working with real-world enterprise codebases, generated code, large datasets, and complex configuration files.

## Core Vision

Enable LLMs to work with unlimited file sizes through surgical precision editing and intelligent navigation, breaking the context barrier that prevents AI tools from operating on production codebases.

## Technical Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Surgical File Navigation**
   - Jump to specific lines, functions, classes, or patterns instantly
   - Memory-mapped file access for O(1) line retrieval without loading entire file
   - Maintain live line index for real-time navigation

2. **Intelligent Search**
   - Pattern-based search without context limits
   - Semantic search for code structures (functions, classes, imports)
   - File-scoped search operations

3. **Precision Editing**
   - Make targeted changes while preserving file integrity
   - Atomic edit operations with rollback capability
   - Real-time line number tracking during modifications

4. **Context-Aware Operations**
   - Extract minimal relevant context for LLM consumption
   - Provide surrounding code context for surgical edits
   - Maintain file state consistency across operations

### Secondary Goals

1. **Multi-file Workflows**
   - Cross-file reference tracking
   - Batch operations across related files
   - Project-wide refactoring support

2. **Language-Aware Features**
   - Syntax-aware navigation (AST parsing)
   - Language-specific search patterns
   - Code structure understanding

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient indexing for frequently accessed files
   - Caching strategies for repeated operations
   - Minimal memory footprint

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **File Manager**
   - Memory-mapped file access using Python's `mmap`
   - Line index: `{line_number: byte_offset}` mapping
   - Change tracking and history

2. **Search Engine**
   - Pattern matching without full file loading
   - Indexing for frequently searched patterns
   - Context extraction around matches

3. **Edit Engine**
   - Atomic edit operations
   - Line number recalculation after changes
   - Backup and rollback mechanisms

4. **MCP Interface**
   - Tool definitions for navigation, search, and editing
   - Resource management for file state
   - Error handling and validation

### Implementation Strategy

```python
# Core workflow:
1. mmap() file to virtual memory
2. Build line index on first access
3. Search/navigate using byte offsets
4. Extract minimal context for LLM
5. Apply surgical edits with atomic updates
6. Maintain index consistency
```

## Scope Definition

### In Scope

**File Operations:**
- Text files up to GB scale
- Line-based editing and navigation
- Pattern search and replacement
- Context extraction for LLM consumption

**Supported Use Cases:**
- Large codebase navigation and editing
- Generated code modification
- Log file analysis and processing
- Configuration file management
- Large dataset manipulation

**Technical Boundaries:**
- Single file focus (not multi-file projects initially)
- Text-based files only
- UTF-8 encoding support
- Line-oriented operations

### Out of Scope

**Non-Goals:**
- Binary file support
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Version control integration
- Syntax highlighting or IDE features
- File system monitoring
- Network file access
- Database integration

**Explicit Limitations:**
- No multi-user concurrent access
- No distributed file systems
- No encryption/security features
- No backup/versioning system
- No plugin architecture

## Success Metrics

### Technical Performance
- Handle files up to 1GB without memory loading
- Sub-second search response time
- O(1) line access performance
- Minimal memory footprint (<100MB for any file size)

### Functional Completeness
- Navigate to any line in <1 second
- Search patterns without context limits
- Edit operations maintain file integrity
- Rollback capability for all operations

### Integration Success
